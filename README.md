# Freelancer Hub – Java-Based Freelancing Platform

Freelancer Hub is a full-stack Java Swing desktop application inspired by platforms like **Upwork** and **Freelancer.com**. It allows clients to post jobs, freelancers to apply, and both parties to manage proposals, contracts, payments, and direct communication — all backed by a MySQL relational database.
